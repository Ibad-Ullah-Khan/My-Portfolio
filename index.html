    <p>Hello, my name is Ibad Ullah Khan. I am currently a student of Computer Science and Biology. I have a deep interest in Artificial Intelligence and plan to specialize in it. Alongside my studies, Iâ€™m also learning web development and programming languages like C++ and Python to strengthen my technical skills.
        I'm passionate about understanding human nature, including topics like psychology, emotions, and social behavior. I'm also working on improving my communication skills, especially active listening and English fluency.</p>
